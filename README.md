# zeebe-snippets

This is your place for code snippets that rely on Zeebe.

Please make sure you have a meaningful name for your folder that gives a first idea what your snippet is about.

Please include a README that explains:
- What is your snippet about?
- How is it developed and built?
- Important additional information

If a snippet is still relevant in the future, please ensure that it gets upgraded.

Also, please make sure you do not commit useless stuff like build artifatcs. To ignore them, please append rules to the `.gitignore` in root.
